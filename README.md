# Bootstrap Themes by ThemesGuide

## A collection of Bootstrap 4 themes generated with Whootstrap

This project includes all the free, open source Bootstrap 4 themes as seen on [ThemesGuide](http://themes.guide).
You can also use [Whootstrap](http://whootstrap.themes.guide) to easily create more custom Bootstrap themes.

## Usage

Clone this repository or download individual themes as desired. Each theme folder contains a `theme.css` file which is the 
custom styles (colors, fonts, etc..) that you can use for your Bootstrap 4 projects. The `theme.css` file should always follow
the `bootstrap.css`.

```
<link href="/path/to/bootstrap.min.css">
<link href="/path/to/custom.css">

```

Additionally, each theme folder contains 3 example layout templates to get your started. Each template has a corresponding `template.css`
 with styles specific to each template, but it's use is optional, and unrelated to the theme styles in `theme.css`.

- index.html (default)
- template1.html
- template2.html

**All themes use the latest Bootstrap 4.1**
